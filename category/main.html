                    <h2>Hi, I'm Alestan ( ͡^ ͜ʖ ͡^)</h2>
<p>I am passionate about technologies, especially in the areas of Data Science. With 13 years old, create an online game on a local server in Java language, but exclude after a while, the local server couldn't take it.
I like challenges, books, developing new technologies, using logic and analytical thinking, in addition to promoting social causes and being a godfather to a 5-year-old child in Uganda, where I am present in her life through a monthly fee that helps in her education through Compassion.
I have knowledge in: Python, Pandas, Docker, MongoDB, MySQL, Jupyter Notebook, Keras, TensorFlow, Django, HTML, CSS, Git, Linux, MacOS, Windows and agile methodologies.</p>                </article>
